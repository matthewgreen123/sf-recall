        <time>May 22, 2018</time> School board Resolution No. 184-10A1: “In Support of a Formal Process in the Renaming of San Francisco Unified School District Schools,” is <a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/ca/sfusd/Board.nsf/goto?open&id=ANVP8B5C815A">unanimously adopted</a> by the school board.

        <time>June 25, 2019</time> The <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/San-Francisco-school-board-votes-to-destroy-14050025.php">school board votes</a> to paint over a controversial mural at Washington High School. The 1936 "Life of Washington" mural, by Victor Arnautoff, had been criticized for its questionable depiction of Native Americans and African Americans. The decision comes after a community advisory committee —  consisting of local Native American community members, students, school representatives, district representatives, local artists and historians — recommends permanently removing the offensive content. But the board’s decision triggers a backlash from the school’s alumni association, art historians and local preservationists.

        <time>Oct. 21, 2020</time> The school board <a href="https://www.sfusd.edu/about/news/current-news/board-education-approves-lowell-high-school-admissions-change-incoming-class-fall-2021">approves</a> a change to a lottery-based admission process at Lowell High School for the 2021-2022 school year only. Earlier in the month, <a href="https://www.sfusd.edu/about/news/current-news/lowell-high-school-admissions-change-incoming-class-fall-2021">Superintendent Matthews presented the policy</a> to the board. With the switch to credit or no-credit grading for the spring semester and standardized testing paused because of the pandemic, district officials said the normal admissions process at Lowell would not be possible. The elite high school’s merit-based admissions system has been the subject of controversy for decades and anger over the board’s decision to do away with it helped galvanize some recall supporters.
